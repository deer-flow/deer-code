# Welcome to 🦌 DeerCode

🦌 DeerCode is a minimalist yet sufficient project to help you learn how to build an AI Coding Agent with a friendly Textual TUI, LangGraph orchestration, and LangChain tools.

## What you get
- **Textual TUI app**: Chat panel, editor tabs, terminal output, and a to-do view wired together in `deer_code.cli.app.ConsoleApp`.
- **Agent runtime**: A LangGraph agent created with tools for operating your computer, editing text files, and updating to-do lists.

Happy hacking!
